# Libft

This is a 42 project. The purpose is to create a C library with important functions used very frequently during the course.

But first, how can I <b>install</b> and <b>run</b> this project? 

### 1 - First things first, you need to clone this repository: 

    git clone https://github.com/richardmarcela/Libft.git
  
### 2 - Go to libft <u>libft</u> and run <b>make</b>

    cd Libft/libft
    make
        
 ### 3 - Compile your main with the <u>libft.a</u>
    
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c libft.a
        
and that's basically it! :)
